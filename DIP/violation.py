Example:
Violation of DIP
How does it violate the DIP?
The project class is a high-level module and backend & frontend are the low-level modules. In this example,
we found that the high-level module depends on the low-level module. Hence this example are violated the Dependency
Inversion Principle. Letâ€™s solve the problem according to the definition of DIP.

# Example 1:
class BackendDeveloper:

class FrontendDeveloper:
    """This is a low-level module"""
