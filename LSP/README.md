## Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP):
>Let φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

>More formally, this is the original definition (LISKOV 01) of Liskov's substitution principle: if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced by objects of type S, without breaking the program.

Liskov Substitution Principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data Abstraction” in 1987.
