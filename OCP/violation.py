# This example is failed to pass the Open and Close Principle(OCP). Assume, we have a super VIP customer and we want to
# give a discount of 0.8 percentage. What would we do in this case? Maybe we will solve the problem this way

class Discounts:
    """Demo customer discounts class"""

    def __init__(self, customer, price):
        self.customer = customer
        self.price = price

        elif self.customer == 'supvip':
            return self.price * 0.8

# But this solution violates the OCP. Because we canâ€™t modify the give_discount method. Only we can extend the method.
